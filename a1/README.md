# Project 1: Introducing the Lab Environment
This directory contains the source code for Project 1. 

To expedite compilation, a Makefile has been provided within each subdirectory to run the necessary gcc commands to compile the source files into binary executables. In order to run these commands, within each subdirectory, run:
```
make
```
This will compile all of the source files within that directory.
